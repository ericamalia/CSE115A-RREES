For system unit testing, we have two major components: 
  Backend API testing:
    - This is to see whether or not the server is behaving as expected.  Sometimes the power goes out and the certain server applications don't work. 
  Frontend Website testing:
    - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qUQHPPe7UBGFNDUO_wVAENJsxExyQ0l9NPY9Q5Xg4zs/edit
    - This is close to BlackBox testing, where we test every path in the website to make sure it behaves expectedly.
