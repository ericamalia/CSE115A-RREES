For system unit testing, all team members contributed to testing two major components: 

# Backend API testing:
* This is to see whether or not the server is behaving as expected.  Sometimes the power goes out and the certain server applications don't work.

endpoints")
* The file **Intrusive Endpoint Testing.postman_collection.json** is for testing most equivalence classes and load testing in Postman.  

# Frontend Website testing:
* This is close to BlackBox testing, where we test every path in the website to make sure it behaves expectedly.
